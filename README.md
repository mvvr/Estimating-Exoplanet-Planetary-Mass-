# Estimating-Exoplanet-Planetary-Mass-
Exoplanet research has become increasingly important in recent years as scientists try to better understand the properties and behaviour of distant planets outside our solar system. One critical parameter for characterizing exoplanets is their mass, which can be challenging to measure directly. In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to estimate exoplanet planetary mass using six observables: planet mass, planet radius, orbital period, stellar mass, equilibrium temperature, and the number of known planets in the system. We trained a deep learning model on a dataset of 550 exoplanets obtained from the NASA exoplanet archive. The model was able to accurately predict the planetary mass of new exoplanets based on their observed properties. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning techniques for improving our understanding of exoplanets and their properties
